A simple HTML page and PHP shopping cart

This simple shopping cart uses WAMP to serve the page, with a small amount of sample data provided in the customers.sql and products.sql files.

To run this code, copy all of the files into your wamp/www folder.  Edit the includes/server-connect.php file to include your mySQL server information.

Create a new database in mySQL and import the 2 .sql files to create a products and customers table with the basic information.
